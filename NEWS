TideCurves 0.0.2
----------------

Changes:

* The main TideCurve function is now way faster for big data, due to better coding and avoiding redundant function calls.
* Added the function ResCurve to compute differences in observed data and synthesis.
* The function PlotTideCurve is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Please use ResCurve and make your own plot.
* Changed the output of TideCurves. i.analyse is no longer part of the ouput & inter is now a column in tide.curve
